This project presents an Arduino-based kitchen automation system aimed at improving efficiency, convenience, and safety. We are going to automate the following using Arduino Uno board:

路 Controlling lighting based on intensity of light in the kitchen

路 Controlling exhaust fans based on intensity of smoke detected

路 Triggering the buzzer when insect movement is detected

路 Smart trash bin opens its flap when an object is detected at a distance

The system is controlled through a software program developed using the Arduino Integrated Development Environment (IDE). Kitchen automation using Arduino enhances energy conservation, reduces accidents, and provides real-time information on cooking processes, contributing to an optimized kitchen experience.
